<h1> Secure File Storage System using Hybrid Cryptography and Steganography </h1>

<h3> Objective</h3>
<p align="justify">In today's world, we have revolutionised a lot in terms of technology; which has led to more dependence of humans on technology and on the data generated by it. Big companies are employing various techniques to process these data so that useful information can be extracted and rest of the data can be stored properly in a secured manner.

<p align="justify">Talking about individuals, they also have large amount of data on their system; assignments, project reports, meeting documents, presentation etc., along with their personal and sensitive documents. Unlike companies, they are bound by the storage limitations of their device. 
Thanks to cloud technology, we got services like Google Cloud and One-drive to secure our data. But are our files safe there? Suppose the individualâ€™s credential got leaked or hacked; in that case anybody can open my account and have access to all my files, causing them much harm. One might suggest to have proper credentials and be vigilante, but as discussed, everything has advanced; so the cracking technique of these bad actors. Hence, people started using techniques like password protection or file encryption to safeguard their files. 

<p align="justify">Hence, we have tried to provide a secure way of file storage to the users by our project, in which one can store files on cloud after encrypting them with hybrid cryptography. Whenever they wants the files back, they can download it from the cloud.

<h3> Pre-requisites </h3>
<p align="justify"> <b> 1. Environment and Repo Setup: </b> It is advisable to first create a virtual environment in a location of your choice using <br><code>virtualenv &lt;environment-name&gt;</code>.<br>It will create a folder with same name. Then, activate it using <br><code>&lt;environment-name&gt;\Scripts\activate</code>.<br>Inside it, clone the repo using<br><code>git clone https://github.com/Nils13001/Secure_File_Storage_and_Access.git</code>.<br>
After that, install the dependencies using the command<br> <code>pip3 install -r requirement.txt</code></p>

<p align="justify"> <b> 2. Setting-up AWS Account: </b> First of all, <a href= "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-creating.html"> create an account </a> in AWS as root user.
After that, <a href = "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html"> create an IAM user </a> as it is always advisable to experiment using IAM account rather than Root Account.
Now as a root user, <a href = "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html"> create a bucket </a> for storing up your files and 
provide <a href = "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-walkthroughs-managing-access-example1.html"> permissions to IAM users</a>. 
Now, <a href = "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html"> install AWS CLI </a> and configure it using <code>aws configure</code> command in CMD. It will ask for Access and Security Keys; those can be created from <a href = "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html"> here</a>.<br>

<p align = "Justify"> <b> 2. Setting-up Mailtrap Account: </b> To use mailtrap, first create your <a href = "https://mailtrap.io/register/signup?ref=header"> Mailtrap Account</a>. After that, click on Email-testing, and you can find your credentials under SMTP settings.<br>

Using them, edit <b>generate_mail_config.py</b> file to add the necessary parameters. After that issue the following command.<br>
<code> python generate_mail_config.py </code>.<br> It will create a configuration file, which will be used to send mails.
